# bio
a longer summary of my life apart from my cv 

This repo will record details of the practically interesting courses I have taken and potentially some previous experiences I have had, e.g. internship or research experiences.

The audiences of these information shall be 1) employers who are interested in my past experiences, and 2) anyone, probably at CUHK, who could use my past experiences to assist their academic decision making e.g. choosing which course to take.
